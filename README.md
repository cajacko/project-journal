# Project Journal 📖

A collection of creative projects by [Charlie Jackson](https://charliejackson.com).

This is where I track the updates 🔼 and work I do on all my creative 💡 projects. It's a way
for me to see the progress 📈 I've made on things, even if there's nothing tangible to see from the
work I did on a project.
