# BEng Product Design and Manufacture at the University of Nottingham

From September 2009 - June 2012 I went to the University of Nottingham to stud a BEng in Product Design and Manufacture. It was a super fun course that was a mixture of mechanical engineering and industrial design. The first year was mostly the same as the mechanical engineering degree and then spun off a bit from there. Focussing more on longer design projects but still with more of a focus on the engineering side than a lot of other industrial design courses. Here's some of the highlights:

- I graduated top in my class with a 1st which was delightful
- Really enjoyed the modules on [sketching](./drawing.md), design process and [realistic visualisations](https://medium.com/projects-by-charlie-jackson/renders-photo-realistic-rendering-fd4ec54289d2)
- Got absolutely destroyed during our critiques in front of industry experts which was a great training for public speaking and presenting
- Did around 10 super fun longer design projects (Check them out in the list [here](../README.md))
- Wrote my dissertation on the [future of home design](https://medium.com/projects-by-charlie-jackson/future-of-home-design-a8f6b810c43d)
- Also there was a reasonable amount of tennis, squash, drinking and boogying down ðŸ¤ª
