This week I was looking at simplification, self balancing and player interaction. So have been testing the following ideas:

- Getting rid of ability cards in favour of more gadgets, which can be bought/upgraded and traded - This gives you more control on what abilities you want your vigilante to have
- Having an upgradable character instead of the ability cards to add to the thematic flavour (e.g. fun abilities) and making characters more unique
- Removed location cards and added the rewards to the map - reduces number of cards and you don't need to worry about shifting cards too often
- Removed individual crime consequences in favour of a uniform consequence - So face down crimes are now unknown
- Starting character and gadgets work in a draw x keep y method - Again to improve flexibility in picking what your vigilante is like
- Gadget cards improve as characters level up - To improve from a thematic point of view and reward you
- Crimes get more intense as you progress - To improve from a thematic point of view
- When the threat track reaches the end you start rolling dice to see if you've lost. This is to ensure there's always a chance to win the game, you can't get to a situation where you are guaranteed to lose.
- You can decide to add chance dice to any thwart attempt, which have 1 + side but also a V (villain) side which solves the crime if it comes up. This means you can always push your luck to try and defeat a crime. You can never not try.
- There are more opportunities to do things during other players turns (use gadgets, contribute action cards)
- To succeed on any thwart you must roll x amount of + results, if you fail the crime schemes 1
- Villains have uniform actions and consequences. But different hit values and rewards. You rotate the cards to show damage
- You can research better gadgets at the hideout, by spending any amount of cards to draw new gadgets at your current level
- All crimes scheme during the villain phase
- Experience still determines number of crimes to spawn
- You upgrade you vigilante as soon as a villain is defeated
- Villains spawn the first time you spot a v1, v2 or v3 icon on a crime card

Here I've been trying to figure out how to make the spread of gadgets/abilities more balanced and personal, so players feel like they can become the hero they want, and don't get stuck with effects they don't enjoy. So here's some ideas I've been playing with:

- Draft initial abilities/gadgets
- Have a selection of gadgets available to "buy" at the hideout. You don't upgrade gadgets, instead the ones available to buy get better over time. Allowing you to make up for a bad draw of character and ability(ies).

I've also been looking at core mechanics as well such as:

- Whether to always have 6 dice, and upgrade the dice as you progress
- Must discard x action cards to do a thwart, doesn't matter what's on it. (Whilst keeping the initial way of adding dice to thwarts)

During this time I was working towards building a version that could actually be play tested with people. Here's a summary of the game at the end of this period:

Zero to Hero is a co-op game of building your character from a normal person to a fully fledged super hero. By battling harder crimes and villains you can level up your gadgets and abilities to create the hero you want. The game creates a randomised city for you each time you play and crimes will keep getting spawned and get closer towards being successful. Each player uses action cards to move around the board, upgrade gadgets/abilities and increase their chances of thwarting crime. The heroes are successful when they have successfully defeated 3 villains. They lose when the Threat level has increased too much (this happens when crimes succeed and villains get an action).

I managed to have a few play testable version of this and had a great session at a play test meetup.

Here's some key takeaways:

- Locations used to be fixed on the board, now they are cards to distribute randomly at the start of the game
- The rewards for solving a crime are specified on the back of the location card the crime was on. Giving a unique flavour to each crime you solve
- Negative consequences for crimes completing are on the back of the crime card, giving a similar flavour to the rewards
- Gadget/ability cards used to have a resonable sized upgrade tree and each was a separate card. Now all upgrades for a gadget/ability fit on 1 card. (By using half a card and the front/back to have 4 different versions)
- Character cards are long and let you slot in gadget/ability cards so you can easily see what's active
- Players draw and play action cards to do things like move, upgrade, increase chances of thwarting a crime
- Crimes and villain actions are triggered in an event phase after each players turn, similar to Pandemic
- Early versions did result in a lot of dice being used, which isn't great UX
- Fate dice were being used where a + counts as a success and a - could be converted into a + by some card effects
- There have been issues with the way thwarting occurs, tried having a set number of turns, action cards that allow thwarting and thwart tokens that each character has. None of these methods quite work yet
- At the moment the difficulty of crimes and villains increases over time, but not the title of crimes or consequences of crimes succeeding. Which doesn't make it feel like the seriousness is scaling
- Crime cards rotate when they are getting nearer to being completed, leading to a nice visual way of seeing which crimes are closer
- Action cards may specify an amount of resources they give when discarded. This resources are used to upgrade gadgets/abilities
- Solving a crime increases the experience track, crimes succeeding increases the threat track. The experience track helps to decide how difficult the crimes should be, the threat track gives an end game condition
