It's geek out time! I've got back into WarHammer and the Batman miniatures game. Lots of gluing and painting. With a cheeky bit of terrain making as well.

Started getting back into WarHammer and painting. Got an Ork starter set and have been furiously painting and gluing. Also got a starter set for the Batman Miniatures game, so painting those bad boys as well.
