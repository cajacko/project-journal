# Improv Stories üìñ

Improv Stories is a digital game where you can write improvised stories in real time with others. It's similar to games like Words with Friends where players take it in turns and have 20 seconds to write the next bit of a story. The app cuts you off when the 20 seconds is up and passes the turn to another player who gets to see your entry before carrying on the story after you.

It's currently in a very experimental state and has gone through many iterations and reboots over the years. I often use this as a project to try out new technologies and constantly start it over again and again.

You can view the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/cajacko/improv-stories).

## Next Steps ‚è≠

- Actually build and deploy a basic version that works. Probably with just 1 story stream

## Updates üîº

### 2020-03-17 - 2020-03-21

This was a new reboot where I was playing with GraphQL over sockets and GraphQL subscriptions, which I haven't used before. So less focus on building functionality, more on playing with tech.
