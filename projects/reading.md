### Hell Yeah or No - Derek Sivers (2020) - Reading September 2020

This books is a collection of Derek Sivers blog posts, which are short, punchy and excellent. Here's some highlights that appealed to me:

- There's always more than 2 options. Brainstorm them.
- When your satisfied say hell yeah or no. When not say yes to everything.
- Assuming you are below average in everything is a better way to live, reflect and treat people.
- It's all your fault.
