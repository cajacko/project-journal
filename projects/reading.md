## Current

### Crystal Mentality - Max Harms (2017) - Reading October 2020

The sequel to Crystal Society. Following the first concious artificial intelligence as it tries to start a new life on Mars.

## Past

### Super Human - Dave Asprey (2019) - Finished October 2020

Read the Blink for this. Not too interesting, reinforced the desire to look into fasting. And might setup my lights to dim in the evening but not much else to report of note.

### What Does It All Mean - Thomas Nagel (1987) - Finished October 2020

Nice short intro to some core philosophy questions. Raised some interesting ideas around:

- Am I the only concious being in the world
- Is my conciousness the only thing that actually exists
- Is conciousness purely a physical construct from our brain/body
- If conciousness is a physical construct then my conciousness is unlikely to be the only one in existence.
- How impartial should we aim to be in life. It's clearly impractical to live a truly impartial life so then how do decide on the balance?
- Why does morality have to be a global thing? Can't it be purely individual. No action can be immoral universally, only immoral to you.
- What injustices are unfair and what should be done about them? e.g. being born into a poorer family than others or being born with a disability.

From reading this short book I cam to the conclusion that a lot of philosophy seems to have little practical application. But the questions which do can be very important. Also the author seems a bit silly as he specifically said he didn't believe something because it was uncomfortable to consider. Silly man.

### Crystal Society - Max Harms (2016) - Finished September 2020

A fantastic original rationalists fiction piece about the birth of the worlds first artificial intelligence. Written from the point of view of that artificial intelligence. It's the first part of a trilogy and is very thought provoking around ideas of AI alignment, setting goals and what are emotions.

### Hell Yeah or No - Derek Sivers (2020) - Finished September 2020

This books is a collection of Derek Sivers blog posts, which are short, punchy and excellent. Here's some highlights that appealed to me:

- There's always more than 2 options. Brainstorm them.
- When your satisfied say hell yeah or no. When not say yes to everything.
- Assuming you are below average in everything is a better way to live, reflect and treat people.
- It's all your fault.
