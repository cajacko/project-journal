## Current

### What Does It All Mean - Thomas Nagel (1987) - Reading October 2020

Nice short intro to some core philosophy questions.

## Past

### Crystal Society - Max Harms (2016) - Finished September 2020

A fantastic original rationalists fiction piece about the birth of the worlds first artificial intelligence. Written from the point of view of that artificial intelligence. It's the first part of a trilogy and is very thought provoking around ideas of AI alignment, setting goals and what are emotions.

### Hell Yeah or No - Derek Sivers (2020) - Finished September 2020

This books is a collection of Derek Sivers blog posts, which are short, punchy and excellent. Here's some highlights that appealed to me:

- There's always more than 2 options. Brainstorm them.
- When your satisfied say hell yeah or no. When not say yes to everything.
- Assuming you are below average in everything is a better way to live, reflect and treat people.
- It's all your fault.
