# Reading, Watching, Listening ðŸ“–ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘‚

Sometimes I like to read, here's my notes on what I've read (or watched if it feels appropriate to go here) since the summer of 2020

- **Blog Post** - [Taking Ideas Seriously Is Hard](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8iHTPoajH5EpFq8tX/taking-ideas-seriously-is-hard) (Nov 2020)
- **Blog Post** - [Notes On Honesty](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9iMMNtz3nNJ8idduF/notes-on-honesty) (Nov 2020)
- **Magazine** - Status Impro Magazine - November 2020 issue (Nov 2020)
- **Magazine** - Status Impro Magazine - October 2020 issue (Nov 2020)
- **Podcast** - The Bayesian Conspiracy - 118 â€“ Guns, Germs, and Guns (except the Germs are actually More Guns) (Nov 2020)
  - Interesting take on the benefits of guns, didn't expect that
- **Podcast** - The Bayesian Conspiracy - 122 â€“ EARN IT vs America (Nov 2020)
- **Podcast** - The Bayesian Conspiracy - Episode 119 â€“ If Youâ€™re A Human, Youâ€™re Already Losing To GPT-3 (Nov 2020)
  - Great insight into some recent AI developments
- **Book** - Crystal Mentality - Max Harms, 2017 (Nov 2020)
  - The sequel to Crystal Society. Following the first concious artificial intelligence as it tries to start a new life on Mars.
- **Book** - Super Human - Dave Asprey, 2019 (Oct 2020)
- **Book** - What Does It All Mean - Thomas Nagel, 1987 (Oct 2020)
  - Nice short intro to some core philosophy questions. Raised some interesting ideas around:
    - Am I the only concious being in the world
    - Is my conciousness the only thing that actually exists
    - Is conciousness purely a physical construct from our brain/body
    - If conciousness is a physical construct then my conciousness is unlikely to be the only one in existence.
    - How impartial should we aim to be in life. It's clearly impractical to live a truly impartial life so then how do decide on the balance?
    - Why does morality have to be a global thing? Can't it be purely individual. No action can be immoral universally, only immoral to you.
    - What injustices are unfair and what should be done about them? e.g. being born into a poorer family than others or being born with a disability.
  - From reading this short book I cam to the conclusion that a lot of philosophy seems to have little practical application. But the questions which do can be very important. Also the author seems a bit silly as he specifically said he didn't believe something because it was uncomfortable to consider. Silly man.
- **Book** - Crystal Society - Max Harms, 2016 (Sep 2020)
  - A fantastic original rationalists fiction piece about the birth of the worlds first artificial intelligence. Written from the point of view of that artificial intelligence. It's the first part of a trilogy and is very thought provoking around ideas of AI alignment, setting goals and what are emotions.
- **Book** - Hell Yeah or No - Derek Sivers, 2020 (Sep 2020)
  - This books is a collection of Derek Sivers blog posts, which are short, punchy and excellent. Here's some highlights that appealed to me:
    - There's always more than 2 options. Brainstorm them.
    - When your satisfied say hell yeah or no. When not say yes to everything.
    - Assuming you are below average in everything is a better way to live, reflect and treat people.
    - It's all your fault.
