# Story ðŸ“–

Every now and then I decide to get into doing my Instagram Story. Mainly as a journaling tool. I save all images and videos from my story to an album and have that playing on a digital photo frame at home. Nice little way of documenting life. You can follow my story on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/charlie_a_jackson/).

Started getting back into my story during Coronavirus isolation. Going well, now want to start creating the weekly, monthly and yearly combination videos that I did before.
