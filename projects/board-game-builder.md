# Board Game Builder

This is a website that loads in data from Google Sheets and lets you apply it to various "designs"/React components and then print them out. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/cajacko/board-game-builder).

## Next Steps ‚è≠

- Improve the admin UI
- Check what other print styles can't be done and whether it needs to have a backend to take screenshots
- Allow you to select the React component via the front end

Started work on building a way to simplify printing out loads of prototype cards for building board games. This site pulls in data from Google Sheets and can apply each row of data to a specified React component. From there you can just print it out. Also includes a JavaScript filter so you can only print out exactly what you need.
