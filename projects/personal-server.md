# Personal Server 👩‍💻

I manage a personal server to do various admin tasks for my life. You know, like a normal person 😉

## Next Steps ⏭

- Fix the bugs with the Trello cron stuff
- Ensure we're not storing ridiculous amount in firestore
- Combine all my metrics (FitBit, Withings, Daily Metrics, meditation etc)
- Handle my Trello automations and improve
- Sync Gmail into Trello
- Add Google Photos to Instagram Story album
- Custom home routines

## Updates 🔼

### 2020-10-26 - 2020-11-06

Improved the folder stucture quite a bit, added crons jobs that link with crons written in Trello labels. Setup logging and started displaying the logs on the frontend

### 2020-10-23 - 2020-10-25

Got the server setup, uses GitHub actions to auto deploy master. The first function I added was an endpoint to grab an array of the latest stuff in my Trello Inbox. Specifically for this custom home widget I have on my phone, so I can display the latest bits on my home screen.
