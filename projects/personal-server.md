- Sync Gmail into Trello
- Add Google Photos to Instagram Story album
- Custom home routines

## Updates 🔼

### 2020-10-23 - 2020-10-25

Got the server setup, uses GitHub actions to auto deploy master. The first function I added was an endpoint to grab an array of the latest stuff in my Trello Inbox. Specifically for this custom home widget I have on my phone, so I can display the latest bits on my home screen.
