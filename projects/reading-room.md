# Reading Room ðŸ“–

Reading Room was a web development agency I worked at from 2015 - 2017. It was a reasonably large agency 100-200 people I think with some pretty big clients that I worked on:

- Skoda
- NHS
- Essex and Suffolk Police
- The Ministry of Defence
- BMI Healthcare
- And other random clients I can't remember anymore

This was my first full time job working as a web developer which gave me a massive kickstart into the world of JavaScript, various standards and how not to do things (agency life ðŸ˜›).

Towards the end of my time here I was leading frontend teams, introduced React to the company, interviewed contractors and was an integral part of the pitching teams. It was a super fun place to work, played pool about 3/4 times a day, played a lot of crazy goat music and had Nerf guns everywhere. I ended up leaving after the company got bought by a giant corporate machine that destroyed the company.
