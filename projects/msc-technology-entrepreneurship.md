# MSc Technology Entrepreneurship at University College London

From September 2012 - June 2013 I went to UCL to study an MSc in Technology Entrepreneurship. This course was essential a start-up boot-camp where you get a degree at the end as well üëç As I had never studied any business before and had started my own little company this seemed like a perfect way to learn, move to london, grow my company and boogie down all at the same time.

During the course you have a bunch of modules on classic stuff like; strategy, management and customer development. As well as a more practical focus on having your own start-up and applying what you learn to it. They also massively push you into the London start-up scene, seed investment and lots of networking (which always had free pizza and drinks so yay ü•≥). Check out [Nine Studios](https://medium.com/projects-by-charlie-jackson/nine-studios-my-tech-startup-9cb36234e17f) for the work I did on my start-up at this time.

- Did a [TEDx talk on the Future of Home Design](https://medium.com/projects-by-charlie-jackson/tedx-ucl-talk-designing-future-homes-6395260d7dcf) at TEDx UCL
