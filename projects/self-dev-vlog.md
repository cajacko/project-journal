# Self Development Vlog

This is a very experimental project looking at doing short videos summarising/expanding on some of the ideas I [write](https://writing.charliejackson.com/) about.

## Next Steps ‚è≠

- Keep doing a few to see if it feels right
- Refine a bit rather than just improvising it in 1 take
- Experiment with a podcast version with others

## Updates üîº

### 2020-02-10 - 2020-02-17

These are the first 2 videos I did to see what it feels like. They are quick (1 take) experiments, using my posts as a guideline for what to talk about

- [Overcoming your primitive mind](https://youtu.be/tCGLy5USmQQ)
- [How selfish should you be](https://youtu.be/cHRZj5J3jFg)
