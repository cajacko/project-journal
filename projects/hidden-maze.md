Spent some time building out the maze idea as an iOS/Android app with React Native:

- Built a control system so you can tap and drag to control direction and speed
- Put and avatar in the middle of the screen who rotates with the direction
- The app generates a random maze on load
- As you move it scrolls the maze behind you

When out for dinner I randomly had the idea for a maze game where multiple players can try and exit the same maze but can't see the whole maze and share resources e.g. keys, monsters etc.
