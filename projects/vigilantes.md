# Vigilantes 🦹‍♂️

Vigilantes is a co-operative board game where players get to start as normal people trying to make the city a better place. As you play you gain abilities and gadgets to turn you into a super hero 🦹‍♂️. Theses changes persist between playing sessions. Unfortunately the villains 😈 you play against also improve over time and the locations in the city you play on start getting destroyed by the villains and their henchmen.

You can find the project [here on GitHub](https://github.com/cajacko/vigilantes).
