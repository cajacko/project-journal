# Writing 📚

Every now and then I indulge myself in spewing my brain 🧠 out into words that occasionally make sense. I tend to write about self development, rationality, technology 💻, entrepreneurship and more recently been doing a few short fiction pieces.

My more recent writing can be found on [here](https://writing.charliejackson.com) and I think all my old stuff is still around on [Medium](https://medium.com/@CharlieAJackson).
