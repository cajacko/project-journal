# Go

Go is a programming language used extensively on the backend at [WalkUp](./walkup.md). I've been slowly learning bits and pieces of it to help with my understanding of the backend systems at WalkUp.

During this period I started doing some basic Go exercises on CodeAcademy to try and get more familiar with the syntax, it's not difficult, just tedious to learn the syntax and patterns for another language. I can't really see any time I would use Go in my personal projects so I'm not very incentivised to pursue this any further. JavaScript can do everything I need it to do and my interests don't require me to learn a more optimised language to do it in.

There are professional reasons it may be beneficial for me to learn this but I don't think that's worth the cost and it's not entirely necessary either.
