# Comedy ðŸŽ­

In Jan 2015 I started getting into improvised comedy ðŸ˜‚ðŸŽ­, and since have been in numerous comedy groups, performing a lot around London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and the occasional international gig ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. Since this I've explored stand up ðŸŽ¤, clowning ðŸ¤¡ and musical ðŸŽ¼ comedy as well. Below is a run down of my active and past comedy groups or projects.

## Current Comedy Projects

- Velociraptor
  - A musical improvised comedy group. We do scenes that end in improvised songs! Started in 2019 we've done multiple shows all inspired from what you do on a normal Sunday.
- NoScript/Smoosh
  - NoScript is the programming (Specifically React.JS and JavaScript) based improv comedy house team for Smoosh (A comedy night by programmers for programmers). We started with the first Smoosh event in 2018 and have played every Smoosh, including our own nights, private events, various conferences and overseas (React Berlin, React Finland).
- Stand Up
  - A new endeavour of mine, I'm currently taking an 8 week stand up course with a show at the end. Who knows where this will lead.

## Previous Comedy Projects

- Clusterfox
  - A long form improvised comedy group. Joined Dec 2018 - Oct 2019, we've played shows at the Camden Fringe, bringing our conspiracy themed show Wake Up Sheeple!
- Clowning
  - In 2019 I did about 12 weeks of clowning courses, resulting in a 5minute solo show at the end.
- And Now
  - A long form comedy troupe I put together for a run of a few shows in 2017/18
- SuperCouth
  - My first long form group, we ran from 2013 to around 2016 (can't quite remember) and did dozens of shows around London.
