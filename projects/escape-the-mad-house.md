# Escape the Mad House 🏚

A co-operative card game 🃏 of improvised stories and escaping ridiculous situations. Basically a
co-operative version of Bucket of Doom but with a single journey/loose narrative. And a specific end
situation.

Currently in a playable state if you go to the project on
[GitHub](https://github.com/cajacko/escape-the-mad-house) and print/write out the resource cards.
Still very much in a prototype stage, no artwork yet.

## Next Steps ⏭

- More play tests
- Experiment with different personality and reaction cards and combinations
- Write more scenario/room cards

## Updates 🔼

This sprint was all about getting the basic idea together into a playable state and to start
play testing so we can see what needs to happen next.

#### Goals 🥅

The goals for this first sprint are to get some basic rules and resources up so the game can be play
tested by anyone. And to do a few play tests and refine the rules/resources accordingly.

- [x] Create v0.1.0 of the rules and enough cards for a basic play test
- [x] 1st play test
- [x] Create enough cards for a 4 person play test
- [ ] Do the 4 person play test
- [x] Write up all cards from play test into GitHub so it's all documented
- [x] Write up new rules from play test v0.2.0
- [ ] Play test with v0.2.0
- [ ] Update rules and cards from play test v0.3.0
