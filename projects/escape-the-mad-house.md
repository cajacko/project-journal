# Escape the Mad House 🏚

A co-operative card game 🃏 of improvised stories and escaping ridiculous situations. Basically a
co-operative version of Bucket of Doom but with a single journey/loose narrative. And a specific end
situation.

## Next Steps ⏭

- More play tests - to see if the new changes work (especially restriction cards)
- Experiment with images (with and without the text) on reaction/personality cards
- Adjust the flavour text so that Derek wakes up in the madhouse

## Updates 🔼

### 2020-03-09 - 2020-03-16

Implemented most of the changes from the last play test:

- Removed the lame, erotic and unusual reactions and added passionate, romantic and creepy
- Updated rules to always draw 2 personality cards and pick 1
- Changed effects of room cards to be +- health and whether to draw a Restriction card
- Implemented Restriction cards which give players restrictions on how they can do the narration
- Adjusted the rules so players always choose the item cards for the narrator
- Ensured every failure removes health

- Experiment with images (with and without the text) on reaction/personality cards
- Update rules to always draw 2 personality cards and pick 1
- Remove advantages/disadvantages from room cards and instead give disadvantages that effect the way you narrate stories e.g. Narrate in 1 breath
- Ensure every failure removes health
- Adjust the rules so players always choose the item cards for the narrator
- Adjust the flavour text so that Derek wakes up in the madhouse
