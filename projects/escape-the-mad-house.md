# Escape the Mad House

A co-operative card game of improvised stories and escaping ridiculous situations. Basically a
co-operative version of bucket of doom but with a single journey/loose narrative. And a specific end
situation.

Currently in a playable state if you go to the project on
[GitHub](https://github.com/cajacko/escape-the-mad-house) and print/write out the resource cards.
Still very much in a prototype stage, no artwork yet.
