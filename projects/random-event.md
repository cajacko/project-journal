Had some brainstorming and play testing. Played a version of the game just with cards for the first time. Went really well. Came up with a whole bunch of new things to test and new uncertainties:

- **The ratio between PC health, NPC health and damage values of attacks and weapons**
- **How to make the GM role super easy, so not setup is needed**
- **What should the theme for the first release be (fantasy, sci-fy etc)**
- **What should the tone of the game be (e..g Discworld, more serious fantasy ala D&D etc)**
- **What should the first set of cards consist of**
- **What are the best set of core skills needed**
- **How should speed/initiative work**
- **How should we keep track of health for various PC's and NPC's**
- **How do we want people to be visualising the map, digital physical etc**
- **How/what do we display as reference rules to players as the game is being played. If anything**
- **How should we manage range and distance**
- **Should we focus on 1 shots, or campaign play**
- **Is the current system for checks and battle working, could things like classic advantage/disadvantage help or be too confusing**
- **How should we limit powerful abilities/weapons/ammo related things**
- **How does dying work**
- **What status cards do we need and how many**
- **Would allowing players to re-roll if they have proficiency in a skill be a good idea, if they have to take the next result? Adds a fun gamble to the game.**
- **Should we have rolling for hit and rolling for dodge/armour? 1 roll doesn't feel like there's enough player agency**
- **Would fate cards work better than rolling and the story?**
