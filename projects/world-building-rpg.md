# World Building RPG 🌍

A physical cooperative Role Playing Game for 1-4 players. Played inside an A4 book. This book contains maps and locations (which are the actual boards you play the game on). Throughout playing the game you will permanently place stickers on the map and locations to customise the world to each individual book. As you proceed and revisit locations the decisions you made previously will affect how you have to play going forwards.
