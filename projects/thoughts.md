# Thoughts and Ramblings üß†

This project is more just a place for me to jot down the ideas and thoughts that I loosely develop. Anything that's big enough gets it's own project otherwise I stick it in here üëç

When you know something works for you, make use of it. For example I've been trying to get back into writing since COVID-19 and an intense new job sent me out of whack with my projects. I know that writing 10 minutes everyday worked for me beforehand. So I should just push myself back into that pattern. Rather than trying a new pattern e.g. doing longer stints of writing once or twice a week.

I'm reading a fiction book from the point of view of an artificial intelligence that has multiple "characters" inside it's conciousness each with it's own very specific goal e.g. Wiki's goal is to learn everything there is, Growth is about mastering every skill, Face is about understanding humans and being adored by them, Heart just wants humans to be happy etc. Each of these characters trade in "strength" in order to control actions like speaking, moving and accessing resources. It made me think about our own internal goal systems and whether they could be thought of in a similar way.

It can be useful when contemplating decisions to think about what other people you respect would do in that situation. Even if that person is a fictional character. e.g. If you have a friend who you respect for their self discipline in looking after their body and exercising you may think what would Josephine do if contemplating a big fat pizza? Probably works better for less obvious decision making, but the point still stands.

Turns out hiring people is hard and time consuming. And you should really have a lot of plates spinning in case one falls down at the last minute.

---

It's so easy to underestimate how much communication is needed when working remotely. Especially when onboarding and working with people you don't know. Don't assume any knowledge and spell things out (unless the knowledge you assume they have is why you hired them, in which case fire them)

---

Writing about traumatic experiences can really help, but the anticipation of reliving it is super scary.

---

Writing out statements you believe in with a rough % of how confident you are in that belief is a good way of realising you haven't thought about these beliefs that much.

---

Why is it so hard to follow your own advice. Knowing what to do and how to live is easy. Doing it is way too hard.

There's an interesting difference in video games around solving problems and solving puzzles. Puzzles tend to have 1 of few valid answers whereas problems tend to have many or infinite.
