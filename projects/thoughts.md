# Thoughts and Ramblings üß†

This project is more just a place for me to jot down the ideas and thoughts that I loosely develop. Anything that's big enough gets it's own project otherwise I stick it in here üëç

Unfair/unbalanced games (mainly board games) make me sad, especially when care so much for the Intellectual Property (Batman: Gotham City Chronicles in this case). The solution is to feel free to change the rules and keep adjusting into you're happy. Works well with enjoying game design as well.

Productive mornings feel so good. Good to identify your favourite times and situations for doing things. And make those happen.

It's easy to start looking down on people who don't think/try to think rationally. Don't be a dick. Maybe a nice balance is a mix of rationality, stoicism and mindfulness.

The board game community is great and has so many community made resources and ideas. Look on all the tabs on the BoardGameGeek page for a popular game.

Treat all games like you designed them yourself and iterate on them.

How do you surround yourself with the kind of people you want?

Don't feel bad about what you enjoy. Used to love working on projects but they never amount to anything. And it kept making me think badly about not finishing projects. Then I realised it's the start of projects I love, and there's nothing wrong with admitting that. Just needed a way to see the work I had done and feel good about it. Even when I stop without a product. This resulted in my keeping my project journal.

I shouldn't do personal coding projects when I code at work as well. Getting into code holes outside of work is bad for me.

Some philosophy questions just seem a bit pointless. E.g. how can a word have meaning? Not sure what I would change in my life by thinking a lot about that question.

Keep pushing on more pessimistic estimates. The planning fallacy is real.

Get rid of all alcohol in the house.

Just because something seems sad or depressing on the outside doesn't make it untrue. And doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself.

When you know something works for you, make use of it. For example I've been trying to get back into writing since COVID-19 and an intense new job sent me out of whack with my projects. I know that writing 10 minutes everyday worked for me beforehand. So I should just push myself back into that pattern. Rather than trying a new pattern e.g. doing longer stints of writing once or twice a week.

I'm reading a fiction book from the point of view of an artificial intelligence that has multiple "characters" inside it's conciousness each with it's own very specific goal e.g. Wiki's goal is to learn everything there is, Growth is about mastering every skill, Face is about understanding humans and being adored by them, Heart just wants humans to be happy etc. Each of these characters trade in "strength" in order to control actions like speaking, moving and accessing resources. It made me think about our own internal goal systems and whether they could be thought of in a similar way.

It can be useful when contemplating decisions to think about what other people you respect would do in that situation. Even if that person is a fictional character. e.g. If you have a friend who you respect for their self discipline in looking after their body and exercising you may think what would Josephine do if contemplating a big fat pizza? Probably works better for less obvious decision making, but the point still stands.

Turns out hiring people is hard and time consuming. And you should really have a lot of plates spinning in case one falls down at the last minute.

---

It's so easy to underestimate how much communication is needed when working remotely. Especially when onboarding and working with people you don't know. Don't assume any knowledge and spell things out (unless the knowledge you assume they have is why you hired them, in which case fire them)

---

Writing about traumatic experiences can really help, but the anticipation of reliving it is super scary.

---

Writing out statements you believe in with a rough % of how confident you are in that belief is a good way of realising you haven't thought about these beliefs that much.

---

Why is it so hard to follow your own advice. Knowing what to do and how to live is easy. Doing it is way too hard.

There's an interesting difference in video games around solving problems and solving puzzles. Puzzles tend to have 1 of few valid answers whereas problems tend to have many or infinite.
