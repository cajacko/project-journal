# Thoughts and Ramblings 🧠

This project is more just a place for me to jot down the ideas and thoughts that I loosely develop. Anything that's big enough gets it's own project otherwise I stick it in here 👍

## Updates 🔼

### 2020-10-19 - 2020-10-25

I came to think more specifically about how I don't think about a lot of important topics until I'm debating them with someone. I use the conversation as a way to explore ideas. I think a lot of the ideas I have were in my subconcious and I may have been passively thinking about them without realising. But it led me to the conclusion that I should try and figure out a way to more directly force myself to confront and think about some issues.

Drinking too much seems like the keystone habit I need to break, where all the other things I'd like to do would become easier and thus make drinking less easier in response. Positive feedback loop yo.

Asking other people how they're doing may not directly affect my mood, but the changes in their behaviour after this may end up affecting me positively.

Code linting is great at helping you learn to code better as you type. Editors like Hemmingway can do the same for writing.

Being hungry makes it easier to give into temptations e.g. drinking. Manage hunger to help.

Thinking very carefully about your rules and routines whilst making sure you have a very strong why for everything on that list may make it much easier to stick to. Especially if the progress is presented in a super easy and satisfying way. In regards to drinking and morning routine (meditation, yoga, exercise, admin and creative work). You need to think realistically about edge case scenarios e.g. exceptions, woke up late, hangover etc.

Should try microdosing properly.

Always assume people have forgotten plans. And remind them if it's important to you.

If you have a doubt about something just say it and look silly rather than keeping it to yourself.

### 2020-10-12 - 2020-10-18

Bit of a more relaxing week, less thinking more playing games and chilling. Had a lot of interesting thoughts around board game design from doing a development session with Rob on [Zero to Hero](./zero-to-hero.md#2020-09-26---2020-10-18)

I think my background in product design -> UX -> developer leads quite nicely for board game development.

It's important to be very disciplined about the little things you want to do every day. Otherwise taking 1 day off makes it much easier to have the next day off etc. It's kinda obvious yet we still so it. So it can be useful to remember the power of this. As it's easy to recognise something but also easy to ignore it.

### 2020-10-04 - 2020-10-11

Been reading a book on philosophy and it's interesting hearing about a seemingly intelligent person specifically pointing out the flaws in their ideas and saying they can't believe something because it makes them uncomfortable. Just because something is uncomfortable to believe doesn't mean it isn't true.

Remember, nothing really matters. No reason to get stressed by anything and you can help reduce the potential for stress if you keep making sensible decisions in communication.

Dealing with timezones in programming is such a bitch. Why can't we all use UTC around the world?

I don't have a problem with companies having all our data, the issue is recommendation engines and positive feedback loops increasing polarization around the world. Unfortunately an easy way to stop that problem is by restricting the amount of data companies have on us. IT comes with downsides but the downsides of increased polarization are bigger. Maybe there's a better solution around regulating recommended information? But that sounds like a much more complex things to define. However as a believer in technology I'd assume that improved machine learning could still cope with building strong recommendation engines even with less data.

The predicted timeline on big negative climate change consequences seems worse that I anticipated. Solutions sound easy but how to enforce: renewable energy, don't eat meat (or much less so don't over fish and can reduce farmland)?

The biggest problems to tackle in my lifetime seem to be:

- Stop people dying
- Pull the global population up Maslows Hierarchy of needs. Not leaving people behind as you do so
- Decrease the spread of polarization - Seems like an obvious way to mass civil wars otherwise. Reducing the capacity to work on the other issues
- Prevent destructive climate change
- Build colonies off of Earth

### 2020-09-27 - 2020-10-03

Unfair/unbalanced games (mainly board games) make me sad, especially when care so much for the Intellectual Property (Batman: Gotham City Chronicles in this case). The solution is to feel free to change the rules and keep adjusting into you're happy. Works well with enjoying game design as well.

Productive mornings feel so good. Good to identify your favourite times and situations for doing things. And make those happen.

It's easy to start looking down on people who don't think/try to think rationally. Don't be a dick. Maybe a nice balance is a mix of rationality, stoicism and mindfulness.

The board game community is great and has so many community made resources and ideas. Look on all the tabs on the BoardGameGeek page for a popular game.

Treat all games like you designed them yourself and iterate on them.

How do you surround yourself with the kind of people you want?

Don't feel bad about what you enjoy. Used to love working on projects but they never amount to anything. And it kept making me think badly about not finishing projects. Then I realised it's the start of projects I love, and there's nothing wrong with admitting that. Just needed a way to see the work I had done and feel good about it. Even when I stop without a product. This resulted in my keeping my project journal.

I shouldn't do personal coding projects when I code at work as well. Getting into code holes outside of work is bad for me.

Some philosophy questions just seem a bit pointless. E.g. how can a word have meaning? Not sure what I would change in my life by thinking a lot about that question.

Keep pushing on more pessimistic estimates. The planning fallacy is real.

Get rid of all alcohol in the house.

Just because something seems sad or depressing on the outside doesn't make it untrue. And doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself.

### 2020-09-21 - 2020-09-26

When you know something works for you, make use of it. For example I've been trying to get back into writing since COVID-19 and an intense new job sent me out of whack with my projects. I know that writing 10 minutes everyday worked for me beforehand. So I should just push myself back into that pattern. Rather than trying a new pattern e.g. doing longer stints of writing once or twice a week.

I'm reading a fiction book from the point of view of an artificial intelligence that has multiple "characters" inside it's conciousness each with it's own very specific goal e.g. Wiki's goal is to learn everything there is, Growth is about mastering every skill, Face is about understanding humans and being adored by them, Heart just wants humans to be happy etc. Each of these characters trade in "strength" in order to control actions like speaking, moving and accessing resources. It made me think about our own internal goal systems and whether they could be thought of in a similar way.

---

It can be useful when contemplating decisions to think about what other people you respect would do in that situation. Even if that person is a fictional character. e.g. If you have a friend who you respect for their self discipline in looking after their body and exercising you may think what would Josephine do if contemplating a big fat pizza? Probably works better for less obvious decision making, but the point still stands.

Turns out hiring people is hard and time consuming. And you should really have a lot of plates spinning in case one falls down at the last minute.

---

It's so easy to underestimate how much communication is needed when working remotely. Especially when onboarding and working with people you don't know. Don't assume any knowledge and spell things out (unless the knowledge you assume they have is why you hired them, in which case fire them)

---

Writing about traumatic experiences can really help, but the anticipation of reliving it is super scary.

---

Writing out statements you believe in with a rough % of how confident you are in that belief is a good way of realising you haven't thought about these beliefs that much.

---

Why is it so hard to follow your own advice. Knowing what to do and how to live is easy. Doing it is way too hard.

---

There's an interesting difference in video games around solving problems and solving puzzles. Puzzles tend to have 1 of few valid answers whereas problems tend to have many or infinite.
